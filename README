Getopt::Yagow version 2.00
====================================

Getopt::Yagow is an object oriented module that parses command line
arguments. Its primary purpose is to facilitate development of
command line utilities.

It allows to especify the command line syntax as a function call or takes them
from command line. Then it parses the specified command in a simple manner.
If command line syntax is wrong, a message is displayed via
Pod::Usage::pod2usage. Also help usage for util can be displayed (via
pod2usage), using --help  --h or --? (this options are added default).

Command line syntax can be especified 'a la Getopt::Long'. See documentation 
for details.

Using pod2usage simplifies maintenance of help usage and utility 
documentation: both are he same. See Pod::Usage doc.
